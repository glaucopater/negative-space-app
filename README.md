# A negative space generator

Have you ever been in the situation of printing a large image cropping it into smaller tiles? This app will help you to speed up this process with the concept of negative space.

Negative space, in the context of art and design, refers to the area around and between the subject(s) of an image or the spaces between different elements in a composition. Negative space helps to define the boundaries of positive space, which contains the main subjects or elements in a design. The balance between negative and positive space is crucial for the overall composition and can greatly affect how the design is perceived.

In graphic design, web design, and other visual arts, effective use of negative space can enhance readability, create emphasis, and improve aesthetic appeal. It can help guide the viewer's eye and create a flow through the composition. Negative space can be used to create shapes and forms in a subtle way, and it can also be used to convey meaning or create visual interest.
